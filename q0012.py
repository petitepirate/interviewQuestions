# This problem was asked by Amazon.

# There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 
# steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique
#  ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

# For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:

# 1, 1, 1, 1
# 2, 1, 1
# 1, 2, 1
# 1, 1, 2
# 2, 2
# What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, 
# you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For 
# example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time.

# Solution
# It's always good to start off with some test cases. Let's start with 
# small cases and see if we can find some sort of pattern.

# N = 1: [1]
# N = 2: [1, 1], [2]
# N = 3: [1, 2], [1, 1, 1], [2, 1]
# N = 4: [1, 1, 2], [2, 2], [1, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 1, 1]
# What's the relationship?

# The only ways to get to N = 3, is to first get to N = 1, and then 
# go up by 2 steps, or get to N = 2 and go up by 1 step. So f(3) = f(2) + f(1).

# Does this hold for N = 4? Yes, it does. Since we can only get to 
# the 4th step by getting to the 3rd step and going up by one, or by 
# getting to the 2nd step and going up by two. So f(4) = f(3) + f(2).

# To generalize, f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2). That's just the Fibonacci 
# sequence!

def staircase(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return staircase(n - 1) + staircase(n - 2)

# Of course, this is really slow (O(2N)) â€” we are doing a lot of repeated 
# computations! We can do it a lot faster by just computing iteratively:

def staircase2(n):
    a, b = 1, 2
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a

# Now, let's try to generalize what we've learned so that it works 
# if you can take a number of steps from the set X. Similar reasoning tells us that if X = {1, 3, 5}, then our algorithm should be f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 3) + f(n - 5). If n < 0, then we should return 0 since we can't start from a negative number of steps.

def staircase3(n, X):
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return sum(staircase3(n - x, X) for x in X)

# This is again, very slow (O(|X|N)) since we are repeating computations 
# again. We can use dynamic programming to speed it up.

# Each entry cache[i] will contain the number of ways we can get to step 
# i with the set X. Then, we'll build up the array from zero using the 
# same recurrence as before:

def staircase4(n, X):
    cache = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    cache[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        cache[i] += sum(cache[i - x] for x in X if i - x >= 0)
    return cache[n]

# This now takes O(N * |X|) time and O(N) space.
