# This problem was asked by Facebook.

# Given three 32-bit integers x, y, and b, return x if b is 1 and y if b is 0, 
# using only mathematical or bit operations. You can assume b can only be 1 or 0.

#_____________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# We can solve this problem by seeing that if we multiply x with b, it solves 
# half the problem. Since we want y to behave in opposite, we can get the same 
# behavior by multiplying y with (1 - b).

# Now, (x * b) gives x when b is 1 and 0 otherwise. Similarly, (y * (1 - b)) 
# gives y when b is 0 and 0 otherwise. We can just combine the two formulas with 
# either a + or |,

def switch(x, y, b):
  return (x * b) | (y * (1 - b))
