# This problem was asked by Dropbox.

# Conway's Game of Life takes place on an infinite two-dimensional board of square cells.
# Each cell is either dead or alive, and at each tick, the following rules apply:

# Any live cell with less than two live neighbours dies.
# Any live cell with two or three live neighbours remains living.
# Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

# A cell neighbours another cell if it is horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
# adjacent.

# Implement Conway's Game of Life. It should be able to be initialized with a
# starting list of live cell coordinates and the number of steps it should run for.
# Once initialized, it should print out the board state at each step. Since it's an
# infinite board, print out only the relevant coordinates, i.e. from the top-leftmost
# live cell to bottom-rightmost live cell.

# You can represent a live cell with an asterisk (*) and a dead cell with a dot (.).

# _________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# This is a straightforward implementation problem, so your solution may differ. Since our
# board is infinite, we can't create a matrix that represents our whole board.

# Instead, we'll represent each cell simply as a pair of cartesian coordinates (row, col).
# In this solution, we keep the set of cells as a property on our class. Each tick, we
# create a new set of cells that represents the next generation. We pretty much have to
# do this so that changing the board doesn't affect the future cells we process from the
# current generation.

# We look at each live cell, compute the number of neighbours for each one, and preserve
# it according to the rules.

# Similarly, we look at all the neighbouring cells of all the live cells, since any of
# them could potentially become alive due to rule #4. If any of them have exactly 3
# neighbours, then we should add them to the set of new cells.

# For printing the board, we need to find the top-leftmost cell and the bottom-rightmost
# cell. These are our boundaries for the board. Then we can print out each row and cell
# one by one and checking if the current spot is in our set of cells.

# It's useful to create some helper functions here. In our case, we have:

# get_number_of_live_neighbours
# get_neighbouring_cells
# get_boundaries
