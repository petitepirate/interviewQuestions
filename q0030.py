# This problem was asked by Facebook.

# You are given an array of non-negative integers that represents a two-dimensional elevation map where
# each element is unit-width wall and the integer is the height. Suppose it will rain and all spots
# between two walls get filled up.

# Compute how many units of water remain trapped on the map in O(N) time and O(1) space.

# For example, given the input [2, 1, 2], we can hold 1 unit of water in the middle.

# Given the input [3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 5], we can hold 3 units in the first index, 2 in the second, and 3
# in the fourth index (we cannot hold 5 since it would run off to the left), so we can trap 8 units
# f water.

# ____________________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# Notice that the amount of water that can be filled up at a certain index i is the smaller of the
# largest height to the left and the largest height to the right minus the actual value at that point,
# because it will be trapped by the smaller of the two sides. So what we can do is to create two arrays
# that represent the running maximum heights, one from the left and one from the right. Then to count
# the total capacity, we can run through the both arrays and add up the smaller of the two arrays at
# that index.

def capacity(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    left_maxes = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    right_maxes = [0 for _ in range(n)]

    current_left_max = 0
    for i in range(n):
        current_left_max = max(current_left_max, arr[i])
        left_maxes[i] = current_left_max

    current_right_max = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        current_right_max = max(current_right_max, arr[i])
        right_maxes[i] = current_right_max

    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += min(left_maxes[i], right_maxes[i]) - arr[i]
    return total

# This is O(N) time, but also O(N) space, and we want constant space. So instead, we can do this. We
# can find the largest element in the array, and then when we're looking on the left of it, we only
# need to keep the running total to the left (since we know the largest element on the array is on
# the right). And then do a similar thing, but starting from the right side. So the general gist is this:

# Find the maximum element in the array -- let's say it's at index i
# Initialize a running maximum on the left to arr[0]
# Iterate from index 1 to i. At each step, update the running maximum if necessary and then increment a
# variable counter with the running maximum minus the value at that array.
# Do the same thing but from len(arr) - 2 to i backwards, and keep the running maximum on the right.

    for num in arr[1:max_i]:
        total += left_max - num
        left_max = max(left_max, num)

    right_max = arr[-1]
    for num in arr[-2:max_i:-1]:
