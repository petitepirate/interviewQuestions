# This problem was asked by Facebook.

# A builder is looking to build a row of N houses that can be of K different colors. He has a goal 
# of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two neighboring houses are of the same color.

# Given an N by K matrix where the nth row and kth column represents the cost to build the nth house 
# with kth color, return the minimum cost which achieves this goal.

#______________________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# The brute force solution here would be to generate all possible combinations of houses and colors, 
# filter out invalid combinations, and keep track of the lowest cost seen. This would take O(N^K) time.

# We can solve this problem faster using dynamic programming. We can maintain a matrix cache where every 
# entry [i][j] represents the minimum cost of painting house i the color j, as well as painting every 
# house < i. We can calculate this by looking at the minimum cost of painting each house < i - 1, and 
# painting house i - 1 any color except j, since that would break our constraint. We'll initialize the 
# first row with zeroes to start. Then, we just have to look at the smallest value in the last row of 
# our cache, since that represents the minimum cost of painting every house.

def build_houses(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    k = len(matrix[0])
    solution_matrix = [[0] * k]

    # Solution matrix: matrix[i][j] represents the minimum cost to build house i with color j.
    for r, row in enumerate(matrix):
        row_cost = []
        for c, val in enumerate(row):
            row_cost.append(min(solution_matrix[r][i] for i in range(k) if i != c) + val)
        solution_matrix.append(row_cost)
    return min(solution_matrix[-1])

# This runs in O(N K^2) time and O(N K) space. Can we do even better than this?

# First off, notice that we're only ever looking at the last row when computing the next row's cost. 
# That suggests that we only need to keep track of one array of size K instead of a whole matrix of 
# size N * K:

def build_houses2(matrix):
    k = len(matrix[0])
    soln_row = [0] * k

    for r, row in enumerate(matrix):
        new_row = []
        for c, val in enumerate(row):
            new_row.append(min(soln_row[i] for i in range(k) if i != c) + val)
        soln_row = new_row
    return min(soln_row)

# Now we're only using O(K) space! Can we improve this any more?

# Hold on a second. When we're looking at the previous row's total cost, it looks like we're almost 
# computing the same thing each time: the minimum of the previous row that isn't the current index.

# For every element that isn't that index, it will be the same value. When it is that index, it will 
# be the second-smallest value.

# Now, armed with this insight, we only need to keep track of three variables:

# The lowest cost of the current row
# The index of the lowest cost
# The second lowest cost
# Then, when looking at the value at each row, we only need to do the following:

# Check if the index is the index of the lowest cost of the previous row. If it is, then we can't 
# use this color -- we'll use the second lowest cost instead. Otherwise, use the lowest cost of 
# the previous row

# Calculate the minimum cost if we painted this house this particular color
# Update our new lowest cost/index or second lowest cost if appropriate
# Now we'll always have our lowest cost in a variable, and once we've gone through the matrix we can 
# just return that.
