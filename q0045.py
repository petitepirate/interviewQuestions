# This problem was asked by Two Sigma.

# Using a function rand5() that returns an integer from 1 to 5 (inclusive) with uniform
# probability, implement a function rand7() that returns an integer from 1 to 7 (inclusive).

# ________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# We can solve this by computing rand5() twice. This gives us more than 7 options to choose
# from. However, we must be careful not to take the sum or product of the results -- this
# can skew the probability distribution. Consider that there's only one way to make 2 from
# two rand5s but two ways to make 3.

# So we must consider each distinct pair of rand5() results. This gives us 5^2 = 25 different
# ways to pick from, each uniformly distributed. Ideally, we would divide these by 7, but
# no power of 5 is also a multiple of 7 (consider the prime factorization of 5^N), so we
# will have to make do. For our solution, we'll make a table of results:

#     1	2	3	4	5
# 1	1	1	1	6	7
# 2	2	2	2	6	7
# 3	3	3	3	6	7
# 4	4	4	4	R	R
# 5	5	5	5	R	R

# R means we need to reroll.

def rand7():
    r1, r2 = rand5(), rand5()
    if r2 <= 3:
        return r1
    elif r2 == 4:
        if r1 <= 3:
            return 6
        else:
            return rand7()
    else:  # r2 == 5
        if r1 <= 3:
            return 7
        else:
            return rand7()
# This method has a potentially infinite runtime, since it's possible that we always roll the cases where we need to reroll.
