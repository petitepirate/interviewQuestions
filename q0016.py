# Problem
# This problem was asked by Twitter.

# You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a
# log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:

# record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log
# get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be
# smaller than or equal to N.

# You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.

# _____________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# It seems like an array would be the perfect fit for this problem. We can just
#  initialize the array to have size N, and index it in constant time. Then,
#  when we record any orders, we can pop off the first order and append it to
# the end. Getting the ith last order would then just be indexing the array at
# length - i.

class Log(object):
    def __init__(self, n):
        self._log = []
        self.n = n

    def record(self, order_id):
        if len(self._log) >= self.n:
            self._log.pop(0)
        self._log.append(order_id)

    def get_last(self, i):
        return self._log[-i]

# This is one issue with this solution, however: when we have to pop off an
# element when the array is full, we have to move every other element down by 1.
# That means record takes O(N) time. How can we improve this?

# What we can do to avoid having to moving every element down by 1 is to keep
# a current index and move it up each time we record something. For get_last,
# we can simply take current - i to get the appropriate element. Now, both
# record and get_last should take constant time.


class Log2(object):
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self._log = []
        self._cur = 0

    def record(self, order_id):
        if len(self._log) == self.n:
            self._log[self._cur] = order_id
        else:
            self._log.append(order_id)
        self._cur = (self._cur + 1) % self.n

    def get_last(self, i):
        return self._log[self._cur - i]

# By the way, this is called a ring buffer or circular buffer!
