# This problem was asked by Amazon.

# Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k
# distinct characters.

# For example, given s = "abcba" and k = 2, the longest substring with k distinct characters is "bcb".

# ___________________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# The most obvious brute force solution here is to simply try every possible substring of the string and check
# whether it contains at most k distinct characters. If it does and it is greater than the current longest valid
# substring, then update the current one. This takes O(n2 * k) time, since we use n2 to generate each possible
# substring, and then take k to check each character.

    current_longest_substring = ''
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
            substring = s[i:j]

                current_longest_substring = substring
    return len(current_longest_substring)

# We can improve this by instead keeping a running window of our longest substring. We'll keep a dictionary
# that maps characters to the index of their last occurrence. Then, as we iterate over the string, we'll check the size of
# the dictionary. If it's larger than k, then it means our window is too big, so we have to pop the smallest item in
# the dictionary and recompute the bounds. If, when we add a character to the dictionary and it doesn't go over k, then
# we're safe -- the dictionary hasn't been filled up yet or it's a character we've seen before.
