# This problem was asked by Dropbox.

# Sudoku is a puzzle where you're given a partially-filled 9 by 9 grid with 
# digits. The objective is to fill the grid with the constraint that every 
# row, column, and box (3 by 3 subgrid) must contain all of the digits from 
# 1 to 9.

# Implement an efficient sudoku solver.

#__________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# Trying brute force on a sudoku board will take a really long time: we will 
# need to try every permutation of the numbers 1-9 for all the non-empty 
# squares.

# Let's try using backtracking to solve this problem instead. What we can do 
# is try filling each empty cell one by one, and backtrack once we hit an 
# invalid state.

# To do this, we'll need an valid_so_far function that tests the board for 
# its validity by checking all the rows, columns, and squares. Then we'll 
# backtrack as usual:

X = None # Placeholder empty value
