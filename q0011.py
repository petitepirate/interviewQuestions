# This problem was asked by Twitter.

# Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all 
# possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.

# For example, given the query string de and the set of strings [dog, deer, deal], 
# return [deer, deal].

# Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data structure to speed up queries.

#_______________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# The naive solution here is very straightforward: we need to only iterate 
# over the dictionary and check if each word starts with our prefix. If it does, then add it
#  to our set of results and then return it once we're done.

WORDS = ['foo', 'bar']
def autocomplete(s):
    results = set()
    for word in WORDS:
        if word.startswith(s):
            results.add(word)
    return results

# This runs in O(N) time, where N is the number of words in the dictionary. Let's think about 
# making this more efficient. We can preprocess the words, but what data structure would be best 
# for our problem?

# If we pre-sort the list, we could use binary search to find the first word that includes our 
# prefix and then the last, and return everything in between.

# Alternatively, we could use a tree for this. Not a binary tree, but a tree where each child 
# represents one character of the alphabet. For example, let's say we had the words 'a' and 
# 'dog' in our dictionary. Then the tree would look like this:

#   x
#  / \
# a   d
#      \
#       o
#        \
#         g

# Then, to find all words beginning with 'do', we could start at the root, go into the 'd' child, 
# and then the 'o', child, and gather up all the words under there. We would also some sort of 
# terminal value to mark whether or not 'do' is actually a word in our dictionary or not. This 
# data structure is known as a trie.

#So the idea is to preprocess the dictionary into this tree, and then when we search for a prefix, 
# go into the trie and get all the words under that prefix node and return those. While the 
# worst-case runtime would still be O(n) if all the search results have that prefix, if the 
# words are uniformly distributed across the alphabet, it should be much faster on average since 
# we no longer have to evaluate words that don't start with our prefix.
