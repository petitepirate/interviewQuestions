# This problem was asked by Google.

# Given an array of integers where every integer occurs three times except for one integer,
# which only occurs once, find and return the non-duplicated integer.

# For example, given [6, 1, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6], return 1. Given [13, 19, 13, 13], return 19.

# Do this in O(N) time and O(1) space.

# _______________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# We can find the unique number in an array of two duplicates by XORing all the numbers in the
# array. What this does is cancel out all the bits that have an even number of 1s, leaving only
# the unique (odd) bits out.

# Let's try to extend this technique to three duplicates. Instead of cancelling out all the
# bits with an even number of bits, we want to cancel those out that have a number of bits
# that are multiple of three.

# Let's assume all integers fit in 32 bits. Then let's create an array 32 zeroes long, and
# when iterating over each number in our array, we can add up all the bits to its proper
# spot in the array. Finally, we'll go over each bit in the array and make it equal to itself
# modulo 3. This means that any bit that has been set some multiple of 3 times will effectively
# be cleared, leaving only the bit from the unique number.

def find_unique(arr):
    result_arr = [0] * 32
    for num in arr:
        for i in range(32):
            bit = num >> i & 1
            result_arr[i] = (result_arr[i] + bit) % 3

    result = 0
    for i, bit in enumerate(result_arr):
        if bit:
            result += 2 ** i

    return result

# This runs in linear time, since we iterate over the array once, and in constant space,
# since we initialize an array of constant size.
