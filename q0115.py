# This problem was asked by Google.

# Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node 
# values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's 
# descendants. The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

#_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# We can solve this problem by solving the subproblem of whether the tree t has the same structure and 
# node values of any subtree of s. We can implement a helper function is_equal(s, t) that checks whether 
# the two trees have the same structure and values. Then, for each node u in s, we return True if 
# is_equal(u, t) for any u, otherwise we return False. The implementation of is_equal is straightforward, 
# and takes O(min(M, N)) time in the worst case, where M and N are the number of nodes in trees u and t, 
# respectively.

# Once we have the is_equal(u, t) function, we can write a recursion for the overall answer. We should 
# return True if the current node is equal to t, or if either of the subtrees is equal to t. The base 
# case should handle an empty subtree.

def is_subtree(s, t):
    def is_equal(s, t):
        if s is None and t is None:
            return True
        if s is None or t is None:
            return False
        if s.val != t.val:
            return False
        return is_equal(s.left, t.left) and is_equal(s.right, t.right)

    if s is None:
        return False
    if is_equal(s, t):
        return True
    return is_subtree(s.left, t) or is_subtree(s.right, t)
    
# Overall, the time complexity of this algorithm is O(M * N) in the worst case, where M is the number 
# of nodes in tree s and N is the number of nodes in tree t, since we would perform up to N calls to 
# is_subtree. The space complexity of this solution is O(M), since the depth of the recursion can go 
# up to the number of nodes of tree s in the worst case.

# Another way we can solve this problem is by encoding both trees using a pre-order traversal (with 
# null markers). We return whether the string representation of subtree s is found within the string 
# representation of tree t. Since we are using a pre-order traversal, subtrees of t will each be found 
# in one contiguous substring, enabling us to search for the substring from the traversal of tree s. We 
# must mark null pointers during our traversal, as pre-order traversals without these can be ambiguous 
# in how the tree should be reconstructed. We also need to wrap the start and end of the traversal string, 
# to avoid edge cases such as 12 and 1.

def is_subtree(s, t):
        def preorder(root):
            traversal = []
            stack = [root]
            while stack:
                n = stack.pop()
                if n is None:
                    traversal.append('.')  # null marker
                    continue
                else:
                    traversal.append(str(n.val))
                stack.append(n.right)
                stack.append(n.left)
            return ',' + ','.join(traversal) + ','  # Wrap result

        s_str = preorder(s)
        t_str = preorder(t)
        return t_str in s_str

# The preorder(root) function takes O(N) time, and up to O(N) space in the worst case. The overall 
# runtime depends on how the method checking for whether the substring is contained is implemented. 
# The Python 3 implementation uses a variant of the Boyerâ€“Moore string search algorithm , which 
# runs in O(M + N) time in the average case, and O(M * N) in the worst case.

# Finally, we could also check for subtree quality by using a hashing algorithm. One frequently-used 
# data structure for comparing trees using hashing is a Merkle tree.
