# This problem was asked by Google.

# You are given an N by M 2D matrix of lowercase letters. Determine the minimum number of columns 
# that can be removed to ensure that each row is ordered from top to bottom lexicographically. That 
# is, the letter at each column is lexicographically later as you go down each row. It does not 
# matter whether each row itself is ordered lexicographically.

# For example, given the following table:

# cba
# daf
# ghi
# This is not ordered because of the a in the center. We can remove the second column to make it 
# ordered:

# ca
# df
# gi
# So your function should return 1, since we only needed to remove 1 column.

# As another example, given the following table:

# abcdef
# Your function should return 0, since the rows are already ordered (there's only one row).

# As another example, given the following table:

# zyx
# wvu
# tsr
# Your function should return 3, since we would need to remove all the columns to order it.

# ________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# For this question, we can look over each column, check that each one is ordered, and remove 
# them if the column is not sorted:

def bad_cols(board):
    num_bad_cols = 0
    num_cols = len(board[0])
    i = 0
    while i < num_cols:
        if is_sorted_up_to(board, i):
            i += 1
            continue
        else:
            remove_col(board, i)
            num_bad_cols += 1
            num_cols -= 1

    return num_bad_cols

def remove_col(board, i):
    for row in board:
        row.pop(i)

def is_sorted_up_to(board, i):
    '''Returns whether the table is sorted in lexicographic order up to column i.'''
    return all(board[r][:i + 1] <= board[r + 1][:i + 1] for r in range(len(board) - 1))

# Recall that we have M rows and N columns. We're iterating over each column, and checking 
# all the rows are sorted up to that column, so this runs in O(N^2 * M) time.
