// # This problem was asked by Google.

// # You are in an infinite 2D grid where you can move in any of the 8 directions:

// #  (x,y) to
// #     (x+1, y),
// #     (x - 1, y),
// #     (x, y+1),
// #     (x, y-1),
// #     (x-1, y-1),
// #     (x+1,y+1),
// #     (x-1,y+1),
// #     (x+1,y-1)
// # You are given a sequence of points and the order in which you need to cover the points. Give the minimum number 
// of steps in which you can achieve it. You start from the first point.

// # Example:

// # Input: [(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)]
// # Output: 2
// # It takes 1 step to move from (0, 0) to (1, 1). It takes one more step to move from (1, 1) to (1, 2).


//_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
// # Solution
// # We can see that the minimum number of steps would be to walk as many diagonal steps as possible, and then walk 
// directly to the second point. If we were to walk directly vertically and then horizontally, it would be a greater 
// number of steps. We can break down the diagonal and vertical/horizontal components by taking the adding the minimum 
// of the vertical or horizontal differences with the remaining distance.

// X and Y co-ordinates of the points in order.
// Each point is represented by (X.get(i), Y.get(i))
public int coverPoints(ArrayList<Integer> X, ArrayList<Integer> Y) {
    int totalDistance = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < X.size(); i++) {
        totalDistance += getDistance(X.get(i - 1), Y.get(i - 1), X.get(i), Y.get(i));
    }
    return totalDistance;

private int getDistance(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
    /* Get diagonal distance component */

    /* Get horizontal/vertical distance component */
    int dist2 = (int)Math.max(Math.abs(x2 - x1), Math.abs(y2 - y1)) - dist1;
    return dist1 + dist2;
}

// # Or, we can simply take the maximum of the vertical and horizontal distances -- this is the total distance.

// X and Y co-ordinates of the points in order.
// Each point is represented by (X.get(i), Y.get(i))
