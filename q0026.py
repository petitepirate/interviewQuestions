# This problem was asked by Google.

# Given a singly linked list and an integer k, remove the kth last element from the list. k
# is guaranteed to be smaller than the length of the list.

# The list is very long, so making more than one pass is prohibitively expensive.

# Do this in constant space and in one pass.

# ____________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# If we didn't have the constraint of needing only to make one pass, this problem would be
# trivial to implement. We could simply iterate over the whole list to find out the total
# length N of the list, and then restart from the beginning and iterate N - k steps and
# remove the node there. That would take constant space as well.

# However, given that we have the constraint of needing to make only one pass, we have to
# find some way of getting the N - kth node in the list in one shot.

# What we can do, then, is this:

# Set up two pointers at the head of the list (let's call them fast and slow)
# Move fast up by k
# Move both fast and slow together until fast reaches the end of the list
# Now slow is at the N - kth node, remove it
# That only makes one pass and is constant time. The code should look something like this:

class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

    def __str__(self):
        current_node = self
        result = []
        while current_node:
            result.append(current_node.val)
            current_node = current_node.next
        return str(result)


def remove_kth_from_linked_list(head, k):
    slow, fast = head, head
    for _ in range(k):
        fast = fast.next

    prev = None
    while fast:
        prev = slow
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next

    prev.next = slow.next


head = Node(1, Node(2, Node(3, Node(4, Node(5)))))
print(head)
remove_kth_from_linked_list(head, 3)
print(head)
