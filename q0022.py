# This problem was asked by Microsoft.

# Given a dictionary of words and a string made up of those words (no spaces), return the
# original sentence in a list. If there is more than one possible reconstruction, return any
# of them. If there is no possible reconstruction, then return null.

# For example, given the set of words 'quick', 'brown', 'the', 'fox', and the string
# "thequickbrownfox", you should return ['the', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox'].

# Given the set of words 'bed', 'bath', 'bedbath', 'and', 'beyond', and the string
# "bedbathandbeyond", return either ['bed', 'bath', 'and', 'beyond] or
# ['bedbath', 'and', 'beyond'].

# Solution
# We might be initially tempted to take a greedy approach to this problem, by for example,
# iterating over the string and checking if our current string matches so far. However, you
# should immediately find that that can't work: consider the dictionary {'the', 'theremin'}
# and the string 'theremin': we would find 'the' first, and then we wouldn't be able to match
# 'remin'.

# So this greedy approach doesn't work, since we would need to go back if we get stuck.
# This gives us a clue that we might want to use backtracking to help us solve this problem.
# We also have the following idea for a recurrence: If we split up the string into a prefix
# and suffix, then we can return the prefix extended with a list of the rest of the sentence,
# but only if they're both valid. So what we can do is the following:

# Iterate over the string and split it into a prefix and suffix
# If the prefix is valid (appears in the dictionary), then recursively call on the suffix
# If that's valid, then return. Otherwise, continue searching.
# If we've gone over the entire sentence and haven't found anything, then return empty.
# We'll need a helper function to tell us whether the string can actually be broken up into a
# sentence as well, so let's define find_sentence_helper that also returns whether or not the
# sentence is valid.

def find_sentence(dictionary, s):
    sentence, valid = find_sentence_helper(dictionary, s)
    if valid:
        return sentence


def find_sentence_helper(dictionary, s):
    if len(s) == 0:
        return [], True

    result = []
    for i in range(len(s) + 1):
        prefix, suffix = s[:i], s[i:]
        if prefix in dictionary:
            rest, valid = find_sentence_helper(dictionary, suffix)
            if valid:
                return [prefix] + rest, True
    return [], False

# This will run in O(2^N) time, however. This is because in the worst case, say, for
# example, s = "aaaaab" and dictionary = ["a", "aa", "aaa", "aaaa", "aaaaa"], we will end
# up exploring every single path, or every combination of letters, and the total number
# of combinations of characters is 2^N.

# We can improve the running time by using dynamic programming to store repeated
# subcomputations. This reduces the running time to just O(N^2). We'll keep a dictionary
# that maps from indices to the last word that can be made up to that index. We'll call
# these starts. Then, we just need to do two nested for loops, one that iterates over the
# whole string and tries to find a start at that index, and a loop that checks each start
# to see if a new word can be made from that start to the current index.

# Now we can simply take the start at the last index and build our sentence backwards:


def find_sentence2(s, dictionary):
    starts = {0: ''}
    for i in range(len(s) + 1):
        new_starts = starts.copy()
        for start_index, _ in starts.items():
            word = s[start_index:i]
            if word in dictionary:
                new_starts[i] = word
        starts = new_starts.copy()

    result = []
    current_length = len(s)
    if current_length not in starts:
        return None
    while current_length > 0:
        word = starts[current_length]
        current_length -= len(word)
        result.append(word)

    return list(reversed(result))

# Now this runs in O(N^2) time and O(N) space.
