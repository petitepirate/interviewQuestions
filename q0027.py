# This problem was asked by Facebook.

# Given a string of round, curly, and square open and closing brackets, return whether the
# brackets are balanced (well-formed).

# For example, given the string "([])[]({})", you should return true.

# Given the string "([)]" or "((()", you should return false.

# ______________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# In this case, it's easy to start with a simplified case of the problem, which is dealing
# with only round brackets. Notice that in this case, we just need to keep track of the current
# number of open brackets -- each closing bracket should be matched with the rightmost open
# bracket. So we can keep a counter and increment it for every open bracket we see and decrement
# it on every closing bracket. If we get to the end of the string and have a non-zero number,
# then it means it's unbalanced. A negative number would indicate more closing brackets than
# open ones, and a positive number would indicate the opposite.

# In the case of round, curly, and square brackets, we need to also keep track of what kind
# of brackets they are as well, because we can't match a round open bracket with a curly square.
# In this case, we can use a stack to keep track of the actual bracket character and push onto
# it whenever we encounter an open bracket, and pop if we encounter a matching closing bracket
# to the top of the stack. If the stack is empty or it's not the correct matching bracket, then
# we'll return false. If, by the end of the iteration, we have something left over in the stack,
# then it means it's unbalanced -- so we'll return whether it's empty or not.

def balance(s):
    stack = []
    for char in s:
        if char in ["(", "[", "{"]:
            stack.append(char)
        else:
            # Check character is not unmatched
            if not stack:
                return False

            # Char is a closing bracket, check top of stack if it matches
            if (char == ")" and stack[-1] != "(") or \
               (char == "]" and stack[-1] != "[") or \
               (char == "}" and stack[-1] != "{"):
                return False
            stack.pop()

    return len(stack) == 0

# Fun fact: "(())" is not a palindrome, nor is "()()". "())(" is a palindrome, though.
