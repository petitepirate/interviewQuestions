# This problem was asked by Dropbox.

# What does the below code snippet print out? How can we fix the anonymous functions 
# to behave as we'd expect?

# functions = []
# for i in range(10):
#     functions.append(lambda : i)

# for f in functions:
#     print(f())

# ____________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# At a first glance, it seems like the snippet should print out from 0 to 9. But 
# actually, it prints 9 10 times.

# The problem is that the functions have closure and have access to the non-local 
# variable i. We instead want the value of i when the functions are declared.

# In order to solve this issue, we should capture the value i when the functions are 
# declared. This would make i a local variable inside the anonymous functions.

functions = []
for i in range(10):
    functions.append(lambda i=i: i)

for f in functions:
    print(f())
