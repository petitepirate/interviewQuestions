# This problem was asked by Snapchat.

# Given an array of time intervals (start, end) for classroom lectures (possibly overlapping), find the minimum
# number of rooms required.

# For example, given [(30, 75), (0, 50), (60, 150)], you should return 2.

# _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# First, notice that the minimum number of classroom halls is the maximum number of overlapping intervals.

# Now let's consider the naive approach. We could go through each interval and check every other interval and see
# if it overlaps, keeping track of the largest number of overlapping intervals.

def overlaps(a, b):
    start_a, end_a = a
    start_b, end_b = b
    # It doesn't overlap if it's like this:
    #   |start_a .... end_a|  <---> |start_b ... end_b|
    # or like this:
    #   |start_b .... end_b|  <---> |start_a ... end_a|
    # so return not or either of these
    return not (end_a < start_b or start_a > end_b)


def max_overlapping(intervals):
    current_max = 0
    for interval in intervals:
        num_overlapping = sum(overlaps(interval, other_interval)
                              for other_interval in intervals
                              if interval is not other_interval)
        current_max = max(current_max, num_overlapping)
    return current_max

# This would take O(n^2) time, since we're checking each interval pairwise. Can we do any better?

# One solution is to extract the start times and end times of all the intervals and sort them. Then we can start
# two pointers on each list, and consider the following:

# If the current start is before the current end, then we have a new overlap. Increment the start pointer.
# If the current start is after the current end, then our overlap closes. Increment the end pointer.
# All that's left to do is keep a couple variables to keep track of the maximum number of overlaps we've seen so
# far and the current number of overlaps.

        else:
            current_overlap -= 1
            j += 1
    return current_max

# This runs in O(n log n) time, since we have to sort the intervals.
