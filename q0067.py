# This problem was asked by Google.

# Implement an LFU (Least Frequently Used) cache. It should be able to 
# be initialized with a cache size n, and contain the following methods:

# set(key, value): sets key to value. If there are already n items in 
# the cache and we are adding a new item, then it should also remove the 
# least frequently used item. If there is a tie, then the least recently 
# used key should be removed.
# get(key): gets the value at key. If no such key exists, return null.
# Each operation should run in O(1) time.

#_____________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# This problem is similar to the LRU cache problem (Problem #52), but 
# requires a different perspective. In that problem, we used a doubly 
# linked list of nodes and a hash table that mapped keys to the nodes. 
# When we evicted from the cache, we just had to look at the head of the 
# linked list.

# In this solution, we keep two dictionaries: one mapping from keys to
#  values (and their frequencies), and another mapping from frequency 
# counts to a deque of keys.

# When we set a key, we first check if we need to evict another key. 
# If we do, then we'll look at the entry in our frequency map with the 
# lowest frequency and pop from the left (since we'll be appending, the 
# left will be the least recently used entry). Then we can add our 
# mapping to the dicts: we'll add our key and value (along with a 
# frequency of one) to our value mapping, and also to our frequency 
# mapping at key 1.

# If we're updating a key (the key already exists), then it's a different 
# story. Here, we will need to basically only update the value mapping by 
# setting a new value and increment the frequency. For the frequency mapping, 
# we'll need to move our key to the next frequency bucket, creating it if 
# necessary via defaultdict.

# Getting a key has similar logic to updating it, without actually 
# updating it.
