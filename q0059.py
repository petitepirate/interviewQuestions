# This problem was asked by Google.
# Implement a file syncing algorithm for two computers over a low-bandwidth network. What 
# if we know the files in the two computers are mostly the same?

# _______________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# If the files on the two computers are radically different, then we have basically no 
# choice: we must make the sender send over the whole file. We can compress it to save 
# some space, but that's about it.
# We can do a bit more if the files are similar. Ideally, we would like to just send over 
# the deltas, i.e. the differences between the two files. However, the problem here is we 
# don't know what's different, so we don't know what to send! So we're back to sending over 
# the whole file.

# We know that we can definitely send over deltas -- after all, it's the basis of utilities 
# like rsync, and is also widely used for patching games and software! How is it done?

# The basic idea is to have the receiver compute a small checksum or fingerprint for 
# non-overlapping blocks of the file it has, and send that over. Then, the sender can just 
# verify, using the same process, which blocks are different, and then send only the data 
# required for those. Now, if the files are identical, we no longer need to send the whole 
# file! We only need to send the fingerprints for the file over, which should be tiny.
# Sounds great! But there's one problem: what if the files are of different lengths? Or 
# worse: they're different lengths, and the appended section is at the beginning of the 
# file. Then all the checksums will be off, and we'll need to send over the whole file 
# again, even if we just appended one section!

# The solution to this problem is to change how we're matching blocks. After the receiver 
# sends all the checksums, the sender can compute the checksum at every possible offset to 
# find one that matches. If it does, then we just send all the data from the last point to 
# the beginning of the current block, as well as some sort of signal that the block matched.

# P.S. This algorithm is how the rsync utility is implemented, and was first described here. 
# It's surprisingly short and easy to read! A few things in the paper that aren't 
# mentioned here:

# Rolling checksums for efficiently computing checksums at every possible offset.
# Using a weak (rolling) checksum and a strong one for efficiency
# Storing the checksums in a hashtable for easier lookup
