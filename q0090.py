# This question was asked by Google.

# Given an integer n and a list of integers l, write a function that randomly generates a 
# number from 0 to n-1 that isn't in l (uniform).

#__________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# One way we can approach this problem is by using rejection sampling. First, we generate a 
# (uniformly) random integer between 0 and n-1 (inclusive). Then, we check whether the random 
# integer is found within the list l. If it is found, then generate repeat the process. If 
# it is not found, then return that number. To make sure we can check for the presence of 
# a number in O(1) time, we can put all integers in l in a set.

# Since this solution involves repeatedly generating a new random number, it could have 
# up to infinite worst-case runtime. The initial call also incurs O(N) to convert list into 
# a set. The probability of selecting a random number depends on the the ratio of numbers 
# in l that are within the bounds 0 to n-1, versus the number n.

# Another way we can approach this problem is by generating a random number strictly from 
# the numbers available. We can construct the list of numbers of available by subtracting 
# the set of integers in l from the set of integers in the range 0 to n-1. Then, we can 
# simply generate a random number within 0 and the length of this new list, and return the 
# integer at that index.

# This solution takes O(N) time to pre-process the list, and O(1) time to generate a 
# random integer.
