# This problem was asked by Google.

# Given an undirected graph represented as an adjacency matrix and an integer k, write a 
# function to determine whether each vertex in the graph can be colored such that no two 
# adjacent vertices share the same color using at most k colors.

#___________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# We can use backtracking to solve this problem. More specifically, we start at vertex 0, 
# try out every color from 0 to k - 1, and then see if we can recursively paint the rest 
# of the graph without any conflicting colors. We'll create a helper function 
# valid(graph, colors) that looks at the last colored vertex and all its neighbours to see 
# if it conflicts with any of its neighbours (i.e. has the same color). We can skip over 
# all uncolored vertices here.

# To represent the colors, we can just keep a separate colors list that maps 1-to-1 with 
# he vertices. You can also convert the graph into nodes and add a color property as well.

def valid(graph, colors):
    last_vertex, last_color = len(colors) - 1, colors[-1]
    colored_neighbors = [i
            for i, has_edge
            in enumerate(graph[last_vertex])
            if has_edge and i < last_vertex]
    for neighbor in colored_neighbors:
        if colors[neighbor] == last_color:
            return False
    return True

def colorable(graph, k, colors=[]):
    if len(colors) == len(graph):
        return True

    for i in range(k):
        colors.append(i)
        if valid(graph, colors):
            if colorable(graph, k, colors):
                return True
        colors.pop()

    return False

# This runs in O(k^N) time and O(k) space, where N is the number of vertices, since we're 
# iterating over k colors and we are backtracking over N vertices.
