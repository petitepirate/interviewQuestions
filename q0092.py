# This problem was asked by Airbnb.

# We're given a hashmap associating each courseId key with a list of courseIds values, 
# which represents that the prerequisites of courseId are courseIds. Return a sorted 
# ordering of courses such that we can finish all courses.

# Return null if there is no such ordering.

# For example, given {'CSC300': ['CSC100', 'CSC200'], 'CSC200': ['CSC100'], 'CSC100': []}, 
# should return ['CSC100', 'CSC200', 'CSCS300'].

# Solution
# This is a classic topological sorting question. One way to think about this problem is to 
# think about how would you go about solving it manually? We can divide it into these two 
# steps:

# Put all courses with no pre-requisites into our todo list.
# For each course C in the todo list, find each course D which have C as a prerequisite 
# and remove C from its list. Add D to the todo list.
# If in the end we couldn't take some courses, this means that were was a circular 
# dependency.

def courses_to_take(course_to_prereqs):
    # Copy list values into a set for faster removal.
    course_to_prereqs = {c: set(p) for c, p in course_to_prereqs.items()}

    todo = [c for c, p in course_to_prereqs.items() if not p]

    # Used to find courses D which have C as a prerequiste
    prereq_to_coures = {}
    for course in course_to_prereqs:
        for prereq in course_to_prereqs[course]:
            if prereq not in prereq_to_coures:
                prereq_to_coures[prereq] = []

            prereq_to_coures[prereq].append(course)

    result = [] # courses we need to take in order

    while todo:
        prereq = todo.pop()
        result.append(prereq)

        # Find which courses are now free to take

        for c in prereq_to_coures.get(prereq, []):
            course_to_prereqs[c].remove(prereq)
            if not course_to_prereqs[c]:
                todo.append(c)

    # Cicrcular dependency
    if len(result) < len(course_to_prereqs):
        return None
    return result
