# This problem was asked by Google.

# The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets. Write a function
# that, given a set, generates its power set.

# For example, given the set {1, 2, 3}, it should return
# {{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}.

# You may also use a list or array to represent a set.

# ___________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# To gain some intuition about this problem, let's try some examples:

# If we're given the empty set ({}), then the power set is a set with only
# the empty set in it: {{}}
# If we're given a set with one element in it ({a}), then the power set is
# a set with two sets: an empty set and a set with the element in
# it: {{}, {a}}

# If we're given a set with two elements in it ({a, b}), then the power is
# has four sets: {{}, {a}, {b}, {a, b}}
# What's the pattern?

# Notice that going from the empty set to {a}, that we still keep the
# empty set in our result and have another set with a in it. Similarly,
# when going from one element to two, we keep the same result set with
# one element ({}, {a}), but we also have a duplicate set with the b in
# it ({b}, {a ,b}).

# So we can use the following recursive formula to generate the power set:

# If the input set is empty, return a set with an empty set in it
# Otherwise, take an element from our set. Let's call it x.
# Generate the power set of our input set without x. Let's call it
# result, for lack of a better name.
# Return the union of name with name + x

def power_set(s):
    if not s:
        return [[]]
    result = power_set(s[1:])
    return result + [subset + [s[0]] for subset in result]

# This runs in O(2^N) time and space, since that's how many subsets there are.
