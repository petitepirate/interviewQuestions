# This problem was asked by Apple.

# Implement a job scheduler which takes in a function f and an integer n, and
# calls f after n milliseconds.

# __________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# We can implement the job scheduler in many different ways, so don't worry
# if your solution is different from ours. Here is just one way:

# First, let's try the most straightforward solution. That would probably be to
# spin off a new thread on each function we want to delay, sleep the requested
# amount, and then run the function. It might look something like this:

import threading
from time import sleep, time


class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def delay(self, f, n):
        def sleep_then_call(n):
            sleep(n / 1000)
            f()
        t = threading.Thread(target=sleep_then_call)
        t.start()


# While this works, there is a huge problem with this method: we spin
# off a new thread each time we call delay! That means the number of
# threads we use could easily explode. We can get around this by having
# only one dedicated thread to call the functions, and storing the functions
# we need to call in some data structure. In this case, we use a list. We also
# have to do some sort of polling now to check when to run a function. We
# can store each function along with a unix epoch timestamp that tells it when
# it should run by. Then we'll poll some designated tick amount and check the
# list for any jobs that are due to be run, run them, and then remove them from
# the list.


class Scheduler2:
    def __init__(self):
        self.fns = []  # tuple of (fn, time)
        t = threading.Thread(target=self.poll)
        t.start()

    def poll(self):
        while True:
            now = time() * 1000
            for fn, due in self.fns:
                if now > due:
                    fn()
            self.fns = [(fn, due) for (fn, due) in self.fns if due > now]
            sleep(0.01)

    def delay(self, f, n):
        self.fns.append((f, time() * 1000 + n))


# We'll stop here, but you can go much farther with this. Some extra credit work:

# Extend the scheduler to allow calling delayed functions with variables
# Use a heap instead of a list to keep track of the next job to run more
# efficiently
# Use a condition variable instead of polling(it just polls lower in the stack)
# Use a threadpool or other mechanism to decrease the chance of starvation
# (one thread not being able to run because of another running thread)
