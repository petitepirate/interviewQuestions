# This problem was asked by Google.

# Given an array of strictly the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B', segregate the values of the array
# so that all the Rs come first, the Gs come second, and the Bs come last. You can only swap
# elements of the array.

# Do this in linear time and in-place.

# For example, given the array ['G', 'B', 'R', 'R', 'B', 'R', 'G'], it should become
# ['R', 'R', 'R', 'G', 'G', 'B', 'B'].

# _______________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# It may be easier to first consider an easier problem: one with only two possible values, say
# 'R' and 'G'. Then we could maintain the following loop invariant quite easily:

# Maintain three sections of the array using two indices, low and high:
# Strictly 'R's: array[:low]
# Unknown: array[low:high]
# Strictly 'G's: array[high:]
# Initially, low will be 0 and high will be len(array) - 1, since the whole array is unknown. As
# we iterate over the array, we'll swap any 'G's we see to the third section and decrement high.
# If we see an 'R', then we just need to increment low, since that's where it belongs. We can
# terminate once low crosses high. So we can gradually shrink our unknown section through the
# following algorithm:

def partition(arr):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        if arr[low] == 'R':
            low += 1
        else:
            arr[low], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[low]
            high -= 1

# This correctly partitions our array into two separate categories. How can we extend this to
# three partitions? Let's maintain four sections using 3 indices, low, mid, and high:

# Strictly 'R's: array[:low]
# Strictly 'G's: array[low:mid]
# Unknown: array[mid:high]
# Strictly 'B's: array[high:]
# We'll initialize low and mid both to 0, and high to len(array) - 1 so that our unknown
# section is the whole array, as before. To maintain this invariant, we should do the following:

# Look at array[mid]:
# If it's R, then swap array[low] with array[mid] and increment low and mid
# If it's G, then just increment mid; it's where it should be
# If it's B, then swap array[mid] with array[high] and decrement high
# Once mid crosses over with high, then our unknown section is gone and we can terminate.

# Our solution looks like this:


def partition2(arr):
    low, mid, high = 0, 0, len(arr) - 1
    while mid <= high:
        if arr[mid] == 'R':
            arr[low], arr[mid] = arr[mid], arr[low]
            low += 1
            mid += 1
        elif arr[mid] == 'G':
            mid += 1
        else:
            arr[mid], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[mid]
            high -= 1
