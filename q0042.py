# This problem was asked by Google.

# Given a list of integers S and a target number k, write a function that returns a subset of S
# that adds up to k. If such a subset cannot be made, then return null.

# Integers can appear more than once in the list. You may assume all numbers in the list are
# positive.

# For example, given S = [12, 1, 61, 5, 9, 2] and k = 24, return [12, 9, 2, 1] since it sums
# up to 24.

# ______________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# Let's consider the brute force method: selecting all subsets, summing them, and checking if
# they equal k. That would take O(2^N * N) time, since generating all subsets takes O(2^N)
# and we need to sum everything in the subset.

# We can do a little better by implicitly computing the sum. That is, for each call, we can
# basically choose whether to pick some element (let's say the last) in our set and recursively
# looking for k - last in the remaining part of the list, or exclude the last element and keep on
# looking for k in the remaining part of the list recursively.

def subset_sum(nums, k):
    if k == 0:
        return []
    if not nums and k != 0:
        return None

    nums_copy = nums[:]
    last = nums_copy.pop()

    with_last = subset_sum(nums_copy, k - last)
    without_last = subset_sum(nums_copy, k)
    if with_last is not None:
        return with_last + [last]
    if without_last is not None:
        return without_last

# This will run in O(2^N) theoretically, but practically, since we copy the whole array on each
#  call, it's still O(2^N * N), which is worse than exponential.

# Let's try to improve the running time by using dynamic programming. We have the recursive
# formula nailed down. How can we use bottom-up dynamic programming to improve the runtime?

# We can construct a table A that's size len(nums) + 1 by k + 1. At each index A[i][j], we'll
# keep a subset of the list from 0..i (including lower, excluding upper bound) that can add up
# to j, or null if no list can be made. Then we will fill up the table using pre-computed values
# and once we're done, we should be able to just return the value at A[-1][-1]. Let's first
# initialize the list:


A = [[None for _ in range(k + 1)] for _ in range(len(nums) + 1)]

# To begin, we can initialize each element of the first row (A[i][0] for i in range(len(nums) + 1))
#  with the empty list, since any subset of the list can make 0: just don't pick anything!

for i in range(len(nums) + 1):
    A[i][0] = []

# Each element of the first column (A[0][j] for j in range(1, len(nums))`) starting from the
# first row should be null, since we can't make anything other than 0 with the empty set. Since
# we've initialized our whole table to be null, then we don't need to do anything here.

[], [], [], [], [], ...
None, None, None, ...
None, None, None, ...
None, None, None, ...
...
# Now we can start populating the table. Iterating over each row starting at 1, and then each
# column starting at 1, we can use the following formula to compute A[i][j]:

# First, let's consider the last element of the list we're looking at: nums[i - 1]. Let's call
# this last.

# If last is greater than j, then we definitely can't make j with nums[:i] including last
# (since it would obviously go over). So let's just copy over whatever we had from A[i - 1][j].
# If we can make j without last, then we can still make j. If we can't, then we still can't.

# If last smaller than or equal to j, then we still might be able to make j using last
# If we can make j without last by looking up the value at A[i - 1][j] and if it's not null,
# then use that.
# Else, if we can't make j without last, check if we can make it with last by looking up the
# value at A[i - 1][j - last]. If we can, then copy over the list from there and append the
# last element to it.
# Else, we can't make it with or without j, so set A[i][j] to null.
