# This problem was asked by Coursera.

# Given a 2D board of characters and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

# The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those 
# horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

# For example, given the following board:

# [
#   ['A','B','C','E'],
#   ['S','F','C','S'],
#   ['A','D','E','E']
# ]
# exists(board, "ABCCED") returns true, exists(board, "SEE") returns true, exists(board, "ABCB") returns false.

#______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# We can view the provided board as a graph, where the characters are nodes, whose edges point to adjacent 
# characters. We have the choice of performing a depth-first or breadth-first search. DFS is usually simpler 
# to implement, so we will make that our choice. Also, since we can exit the search once we've reached the 
# length of the word, the recursive depth will be limited by the length.

def search(board, row, col, word, index, visited):
    def is_valid(board, row, col):
        return row >= 0 and row < len(board) and col >= 0 and col < len(board[0])

    if not is_valid(board, row, col):
        return False
    if visited.contains((row, col)):
        return False
    if board[row][col] != word[index]:
        return False
    if index == len(word) - 1:
        return True

    visited.add((row, col))

    for d in ((0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (1, 0)):
        if search(board, row + d[0], col + d[1], word, index + 1):
            return True

    visited.remove((row, col))  # Backtrack

    return False

def find_word(board, word):
    int M = len(board)
    int N = len(board[0])

    for row in range(M):
        for col in range(N):
            visited = set()
            if search(board, row, col, word, 0, visited):
                return True

# The worst-case time complexity of this solution is O(MN * 4^L) where L is the length of the word and M and N 
# are the dimensions of the board.
