# This problem was asked by Jane Street.

# cons(a, b) constructs a pair, and car(pair) and cdr(pair) returns the first and last element of that pair. For example, car(cons(3, 4)) returns 3, and cdr(cons(3, 4)) returns 4.

# Given this implementation of cons:

# def cons(a, b):
#     def pair(f):
#         return f(a, b)
#     return pair
# Implement car and cdr.
# ________________________________________________________
# Solution:

# This is a really cool example of using closures to store data. We must look at the signature type of cons to retrieve its first and last elements. cons takes in a and b, and returns a new anonymous function, which itself takes in f, and calls f with a and b. So the input to car and cdr is that anonymous function, which is pair. To get a and b back, we must feed it yet another function, one that takes in two parameters and returns the first (if car) or last (if cdr) one.

def car(pair):
    return pair(lambda a, b: a)


def cdr(pair):
    return pair(lambda a, b: b)

# Fun fact: cdr is pronounced "cudder"!
