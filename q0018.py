# This problem was asked by Google.

# Given an array of integers and a number k, where 1 <= k <= length of the array,
# compute the maximum values of each subarray of length k.

# For example, given array = [10, 5, 2, 7, 8, 7] and k = 3, we should get: [10, 7, 8, 8],
# since:

# 10 = max(10, 5, 2)
# 7 = max(5, 2, 7)
# 8 = max(2, 7, 8)
# 8 = max(7, 8, 7)
# Do this in O(n) time and O(k) space. You can modify the input array in-place and you do not
# need to store the results. You can simply print them out as you compute them.

# ______________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# Even though the question states O(n), in an interview it's always useful to first write out
# a brute force solution, which may provide us with some insight on some deeper structure in the
# problem.

# So let's first write out a naive solution: we can simply take each subarray of k length and
# compute their maxes.

from collections import deque


def max_of_subarrays(lst, k):
    for i in range(len(lst) - k + 1):
        print(max(lst[i:i + k]))

# This takes O(n * k) time, which doesn't get us quite to where we want. How can we make this
# faster?

# One possible idea is this: we could use a max-heap of size k and add the first k elements to
# the heap initially, and then pop off the max and add the next element for the rest of the array.
# This is better, but adding and extracting from the heap will take O(log k), so this algorithm
# will take O(n * log k), which is still not enough. How can we do better?

# Notice that, for example, the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and k = 3, after evaluating
# the max of first range, since 3 is at the end, we only need to check whether 4 is greater
# than 3. If it is, then we can print 4 immediately, and if it isn't, we can stick with 3.

# On the other hand, for the input [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] and k = 3, after evaluating
# the max of the first range, we can't do the same thing, since we can't use 9 again. We have
# to look at 8 instead, and then once we move on to the next range, we have to look at 7.

# These two data points suggest an idea: we can keep a double-ended queue with max size k
# and only keep what we need to evaluate in it. That is, if we see [1, 3, 5], then we only
# eed to keep [5], since we know that 1 and 3 cannot possibly be the maxes.

# So what we can do is maintain an ordered list of indices, where we only keep the elements
# we care about, that is, we will maintain the loop invariant that our queue is always ordered
# so that we only keep the indices we care about (i.e, there are no elements that are greater
# after, since we would just pick the greater element as the max instead).

# It will help to go over an example. Consider our test input: [10, 5, 2, 7, 8, 7] and k = 3.
# Our queue at each step would look like this (recall that these are indices):

# Preprocessing
# After processing 10: [0] After processing 5: [0, 1] # 5 is smaller than 10, and 10 is still
# valid until we hit the 3rd index After processing 2: [0, 1, 2] # 2 is smaller than 5, and 10
# is still valid

# Main Loop
# Print value of first element in our queue: 10

# After processing 7: [4] # 10 is no longer valid (we can tell since the current index - 0 > k),
# so we dequeue from the front. 7 is bigger than 5 and 2, so we get rid of them from the back
# and replace it with the 7

# Print value of first element in our queue: 7

# After processing 8: [5] # 8 is bigger than 7, so no point in keeping 7 around. We get rid
# f it from the back and replace it with the 8

# Print value of first element in our queue: 8

# After processing 7: [5, 4] # 7 is smaller than 8, so we enqueue it from the back

# Print value of first element in our queue: 8
