# This problem was asked by Palantir.

# Write an algorithm to justify text. Given a sequence of words and an integer line length
# k, return a list of strings which represents each line, fully justified.

# More specifically, you should have as many words as possible in each line. There should
# be at least one space between each word. Pad extra spaces when necessary so that each line
# has exactly length k. Spaces should be distributed as equally as possible, with the extra
# spaces, if any, distributed starting from the left.

# If you can only fit one word on a line, then you should pad the right-hand side with spaces.

# Each word is guaranteed not to be longer than k.

# For example, given the list of words ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over",
# "the", "lazy", "dog"] and k = 16, you should return the following:

# ["the  quick brown", # 1 extra space on the left
# "fox  jumps  over", # 2 extra spaces distributed evenly
# "the   lazy   dog"] # 4 extra spaces distributed evenly

# ________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# It seems like the justification algorithm is independent from the groupings, so immediately
# we should figure out two things:

# How to group lines together so that it is as close to k as possible (without going over)
# Given a grouping of lines, justifying the text by appropriately distributing spaces
# To solve the first part, let's write a function group_lines that takes in all the words in
# our input sequence as well as out target line length k, and return a list of list of words
# that represents the lines that we will eventually justify. Our main strategy will be to
# iterate over all the words, keep a list of words for the current line, and because we want
# to fit as many words as possible per line, estimate the current line length, assuming only
# one space between each word. Once we go over k, then save the word and start a new line with
# it. So our function will look something like this:
import math


def min_line(words):
    return ' '.join(words)


def group_lines(words, k):
    '''
    Returns groupings of |words| whose total length, including 1 space in between,
    is less than |k|.
    '''
    groups = []
    current_sum = 0
    current_line = []
    for _, word in enumerate(words):
        # Check if adding the next word would push it over
        # the limit. If it does, then add |current_line| to
        # group. Also reset |current_line| properly.
        if len(min_line(current_line + [word])) > k:

        current_line.append(word)

    # Add the last line to groups.
    groups.append(current_line)
    return groups
# Then, we'll want to actually justify each line. We know for sure each line we feed
# from group_lines is the maximum number of words we can pack into a line and no more.
# What we can do is first figure out how many spaces we have available to distribute
# between each word. Then from that, we can calculate how much base space we should
# have between each word by dividing it by the number of words minus one. If there are
# any leftover spaces to distribute, then we can keep track of that in a counter, and
# as we rope in each new word we'll add the appropriate number of spaces. We can't add
# more than one leftover space per word.
