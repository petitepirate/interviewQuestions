# This problem was asked by Microsoft.

# Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

# For example, given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], the longest consecutive element sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. 
# Return its length: 4.

# Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

#______________________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# We can see that if the array of integers was sorted, we'd be able to find the longest consecutive 
# sequence fairly easily. First, we sort the array in ascending order. Then, we traverse the array, 
# keeping the count of the current sequence. If the next element is one higher than the current element, 
# then we increment the count. Otherwise, we start the count over at 1. We simply return the maximum 
# count we've seen overall. The overall run-time of this solution would be O(nlogn), since we have to 
# sort the input array. Depending on the sorting implementation and whether or not we are able to modify 
# the array, the space complexity would be O(n) or O(1).

# We can improve our solution by using extra space to cache the bounds of sequences we've seen so far. 
# If we get a new number, then we start with a sequence length of 1. If we get a number we've seen 
# already, we can ignore it since none of the bounds should change.

# This solution has a time complexity of O(N), and a space complexity of O(N).
