# This problem was asked by Google.

# Suppose we represent our file system by a string in the following manner:

# The string "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext" represents:

# dir
#     subdir1
#     subdir2
#         file.ext

# The directory dir contains an empty sub-directory subdir1 and a sub-directory 
# subdir2 containing a file file.ext.

# The string "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext" represents:

# dir
#     subdir1
#         file1.ext
#         subsubdir1
#     subdir2
#         subsubdir2
#             file2.ext

# The directory dir contains two sub-directories subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a 
# file file1.ext and an empty second-level sub-directory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a 
# second-level sub-directory subsubdir2 containing a file file2.ext.

# We are interested in finding the longest (number of characters) absolute path to a file 
# within our file system. For example, in the second example above, the longest absolute path is 
# "dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext", and its length is 32 (not including the double quotes).

# Given a string representing the file system in the above format, return the length of 
# the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in 
# the system, return 0.

# Note:

# The name of a file contains at least a period and an extension.

# The name of a directory or sub-directory will not contain a period.

#___________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# There are two steps in solving this question: we must first parse the string representing 
# the file system and then get the longest absolute path to a file.

# Step 1: Parsing the file system
# Ideally, we would initially parse the string given into a dictionary of some sort. That 
# would mean a string like:

# dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext
# would become:

{
    "dir": {
        "subdir1": {
            "file1.ext": True,
            "subsubdir1": {}
        },
        "subdir2": {
            "subsubdir2": {
                "file2.ext": True
            }
        }
    }
}
# where each key with a dictionary as its value represents a directory, and a key with True as 
# its value represents an actual file.

# To achieve this, we can first split the string by the newline character, meaning each item in 
# our array represents a file or directory. Then, we create an empty dictionary to represent our 
# parsed file system and traverse the file system on each entry. We keep track of the last path 
# we've seen so far in current_path because we may need to return to some level in that path, 
# depending on the number of tabs. Once we are at the correct place to put down the new directory 
# or file, we check the name for a . and set the correct value to either True (if file) or {} (if directory).

def build_fs(input):
    fs = {}
    files = input.split('\n')

    current_path = []
    for f in files:
        indentation = 0
        while '\t' in f[:2]:
            indentation += 1
            f = f[1:]

        current_node = fs
        for subdir in current_path[:indentation]:
            current_node = current_node[subdir]

        if '.' in f:
            current_node[f] = True
        else:
            current_node[f] = {}

        current_path = current_path[:indentation]
        current_path.append(f)

    return fs
    
# Step 2: Computing the longest path
# After we've constructed a native representation of the file system, we can write a fairly straightforward 
# recursive function that takes the current root, recursively calculates the longest_path of all the subdirectories 
# and files under the root, and returns the longest one. Remember that since we specifically want the longest 
# path to a file to discard any paths that do not have a . in them. And if there are no paths starting at this 
# root, then we can simply return the empty string.

def longest_path(root):
    paths = []
    for key, node in root.items():
        if node == True:
            paths.append(key)
        else:
            paths.append(key + '/' + longest_path(node))
    # filter out unfinished paths
    paths = [path for path in paths if '.' in path]
    if paths:
        return max(paths, key=lambda path:len(path))
    else:
        return ''

# Step 3: Putting it together
# Now that the hard part is done, we just need to put the two together:

def longest_absolute_path(s):
    return len(longest_path(build_fs(s)))

# This runs in O(n), since we iterate over the input string twice to build the file system, and then in the worst case 
# we go through the string again to compute the longest path.
