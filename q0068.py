# This problem was asked by Google.

# On our special chessboard, two bishops attack each other if they share the same 
# diagonal. This includes bishops that have another bishop located between them, 
# i.e. bishops can attack through pieces.

# You are given N bishops, represented as (row, column) tuples on a M by M chessboard. 
# Write a function to count the number of pairs of bishops that attack each other. 
# The ordering of the pair doesn't matter: (1, 2) is considered the same as (2, 1).

# For example, given M = 5 and the list of bishops:

# (0, 0)
# (1, 2)
# (2, 2)
# (4, 0)
# The board would look like this:

# [b 0 0 0 0]
# [0 0 b 0 0]
# [0 0 b 0 0]
# [0 0 0 0 0]
# [b 0 0 0 0]
# You should return 2, since bishops 1 and 3 attack each other, as well as bishops 
# 3 and 4.

#_________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# One approach would be to iterate through each bishop and find all the other 
# attacking bishops, incrementing the count when we find a pair.

# We can define a helper function is_attacking that returns whether or not two 
# bishops are attacking each other:

def is_attacking(bishop0, bishop1):
    r0, c0 = bishop0
    r1, c1 = bishop1
    return abs(r1 - r0) == abs(c1 - c0)

def pairs(bishops, m):
    count = 0
    for i, bishop0 in enumerate(bishops):
        for j, bishop1 in enumerate(bishops[i + 1:]):
            count += is_attacking(bishop0, bishop1)
    return count
# This would take O(N^2). Can we make this any faster?

# If we know how many bishops are in each diagonal, then we can know how many pairs 
# are attacking: for each diagonal, it's the number of bishops choose 2, since each 
# bishop makes a pair with every other bishop.

# So, if we go through each bishop and bucket them into each separate diagonal, 
# we can just run (b choose 2) on the number of bishops on each diagonal and sum 
# them up. Recall that (n choose 2) is equivalent to n * (n - 1) / 2.

# Each bucket is represented by a tuple top_left_row, top_left_column, direction. 
# (Or right row if it's the other way.) Then we can quickly figure out which 
# bucket a bishop belongs to by moving up each diagonal until we hit a border.
