# This problem was asked by Apple.

# Gray code is a binary code where each successive value differ in only one bit, as well as 
# when wrapping around. Gray code is common in hardware so that we don't see temporary 
# spurious values during transitions.

# Given a number of bits n, generate a possible gray code for it.

# For example, for n = 2, one gray code would be [00, 01, 11, 10].

#_____________________________________________________________________________________________
# Solution
# We can solve this problem recursivelyâ€”given that we have a gray code for n - 1, how can we 
# extend that solution to work with n bits?

# Let's take the base case, the solution for n = 1: [0, 1].

# Now, for n = 2, we obviously need to extend the solution by adding an extra bit. Notice that 
# if we simply duplicate the solution twice, we get close to a solution:

# [00, 01, 10, 11]
# The only parts that don't work here are at the edges of where we're duplicating. Instead, if 
# we duplicated the solution, prepend 0 to one copy, and prepend 1 to the other and reverse it, 
# we get one where the edges match up:

# [00, 01, 11, 10]
# This works because between the copies, the only differences are at the most significant bit.
#  We want to exploit this symmetry and flip the second copy so that at the edges, the only 
# thing that changes is that significant bit.

    if n == 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0, 1]

    prev_gray_code = gray_code(n - 1)

    result = []
    for code in prev_gray_code:
        result.append(code)

    for code in reversed(prev_gray_code):
        result.append((1 << n - 1) + code)

    return result

# This takes O(2n) time, since we're generating twice as many results for each recursive call and each recursive call reduces the input by a constant amount.
